# Customer Behavior Analysis

This auto insurance company is struggling to keep its customers, and most of the renewal offers were turned down by the customers. With the dataset provided by the company, I will perform an analysis to identify customer needs and behaviors to focus on how the company's renewal offer can once again attract its customers. Also, based on the dataset and the customer features provided, I will predict customers' responses to new insurance offers.
